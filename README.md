## Introduction

I am currently trying to further develop my Java and Spring Boot knowledge and thought to implement a Ticket System as 
Use Case.

## Functionalities

Hereby I will write at first all backend services with Spring Boot and will use a MySQL Database as Docker Container. 
Depending on my time I plan to implement the following functionalities:

    - User
        - Registration
        - Login
        - Permissions
    - Ticket
        - Create, Update, Close
        - Set and change owner
        - Comments
        - File input
    - Dashboard / Landing Page
        - Overview

## Versions

| Components  | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Java        | 17      |
| Spring Boot | 3.1.5   |
